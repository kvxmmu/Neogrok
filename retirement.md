# Retirement

I'm about to retire from working on my projects, especially neogrok and about it - it will be abandoned. There is no sense in continuing because since 2021 I didn't even had stable version that just works. Everything was fucked every time, so I decided to stop this clownade. Bye.

I'm really thankful for amazing Rust ecosystem & Rust community that helped me a lot.
Especially Rust as a language helped me a lot because I'm person with the very distracted attention, so necessary checks provided by Rust compiler itself was really helpful.
